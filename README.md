This demo works only on earlier PET 2001(N) models.
Newer 40xx and 80xx CRTC models are not supported.

Some effects require cycle exact timing, so it could 
not work in your emulator. 

If you have a MiniPET from "The Future Was 8 bit", please set 
the "Video Output" dip-switches to 9" PET.

A custom emulator build tested on XPET / Vice
version 3.6.1 (Windows build) is provided.

See the notefile in the floppy disk for tech info.

Watch your demos as intended, only real hardware is real!
